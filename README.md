## Required software
* Java JDK 8+
* Maven installed and in your classpath
## First time execution
For the first time run `mvn install -DskipTests`
## How to execute the tests
You can open each test class on `src\test\java` and execute all of them, but I recommend you run it by the
command line `mvn test`.
## Future plan
Reporting support will add soon.
